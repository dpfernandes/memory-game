Initially you will see all circles turned face down. 
Tap on one of the circles and remember the picture on it. 
With the next tap try to find and flip the circle with the same picture as the previous one. 
STEP 2 - 
If the pictures on the two memory circles will be the same, 
they will stay opened and you can continue with the next pair. 
Otherwise both circles will flip back over and you will get another try. 
Try to find all matched circles as fast as possible.
